Obi-Wan Kenobi, later known as Ben Kenobi during his exile, was 
a Force-sensitive human male Jedi Master who served the Galactic Republic. 
He was a mentor and close friend to both Anakin Skywalker and his son, Luke, 
training them in the ways of the Force.

Born on the planet Stewjon, Kenobi became the Padawan learner of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. 
Kenobi then became the first Jedi in a millennium to defeat a Sith Lord when he defeated Darth Maul during the Battle of Naboo. 
During the battle, Jinn was mortally wounded by Maul, and perished in Kenobi's arms. 
At Jinn's behest, Kenobi took Anakin Skywalker to be his own Padawan, training him during the decade leading up to the Clone Wars.
